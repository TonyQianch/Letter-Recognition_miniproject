In this project, we compared the performance of CNN models constructed under different
algorithms for the handwritten letter recognition task. We used a simple neural network
model as our baseline model for comparison. Our results show that both CNN models
outperform the baseline while the AlexNet algorithm gives the highest accuracy. The
AlexNet CNN model achieves a 98% accuracy and the Keras model gives over 95%, while the
baseline model is at about 90%. We believe that the results are acceptable considering the
limited time and resources such as training data, computing power, etc.
